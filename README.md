# Bellybutton-plotly

## Overview of the project

We learn how to create data visualizations for the web in order to communicate our findings to an audience. We use JavaScript to create visualizations that are attractive, accessible, and interactive. 

We use Plotly.js, a javascript data visualization library to add interactivity that increases audience comprehension with interactive features such as buttons and dropdown menus as well as to retrieve data from external sources like .csv files and APIs.

The project build a dashboard with dynamic charts that both research participants, and fellow researchers can access.
